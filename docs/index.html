<p>If you're new to JavaScript, read the <a href="https://github.com/FullScreenShenanigans/Documentation/blob/master/Getting%20Started.md">Getting Started</a> section to learn how to copy the code and run it locally.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/FullScreenShenanigans/Documentation/blob/master/Build%20Details.md">Build Details</a> has details on the specific build tasks, while other files detail modules of GameStartr projects.</p>

<p>GameStartr is a TypeScript game engine used as a base for creating sprite-based 2D games, particularly retro remakes such as FullScreenPokemon.
It uses about two dozen other FullScreenShenanigans projects as Node modules.</p>
