# Documentation

This is the central repository for tutorials and instructions on FullScreenShenanigans projects.
These are all TypeScript projects tailored to or built on the GameStartr game engine.


# Getting Started

If you're new to JavaScript, read the [Getting Started](https://github.com/FullScreenShenanigans/Documentation/blob/master/Getting%20Started.md) section to learn how to copy the code and run it locally.

[gulp-shenanigans](https://github.com/FullScreenShenanigans/gulp-shenanigans) has details on the specific build tasks, while other files detail modules of GameStartr projects.

## GameStartr

GameStartr is a TypeScript game engine used as a base for creating sprite-based 2D games, particularly retro remakes such as FullScreenPokemon.
It uses about two dozen other FullScreenShenanigans projects as modules.


## History

The FullScreenMario project started October 21st, 2012 and had a beta release in October 2013.
[FullScreenMario.com](http://www.fullscreenmario.com) received approximately 2.68 million unique visitors within a month, after which Nintendo shut the site down with a DMCA complaint (no action was taken against the authors, GitHub, or other hosting websites).

The FullScreenPokemon project started in October of 2014 during the refactor after an April Fools Day joke release that year.
